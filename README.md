# Notes

- Describe any challenges encountered while building the app

- When implementing the feature to allow the user to input a party size I ran into troubles updating the UI correctly. I tried to implement 2 functions. 1 that would calculate the tip and 1 that would calculate the split when a party size was inputted, but passing variables between these functions proved difficult. My solution was to calculate both tip and split in the same function

- Finding a good source to figure out how to add the iMessage functionality in the way I wanted it was somewhat tedious. Google and Stack Overflow have never failed me, however, and after a couple of tries I was able to implement this functionality
